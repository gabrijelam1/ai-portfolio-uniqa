# AI Portfolio for UNIQA | Building an AI Strategy in Just 2 Years

## Overview
With a commitment to customer well-being and organizational success, this AI portfolio positions UNIQA as a leader in AI-driven insurance solutions while ensuring strict compliance with the AI Act and GDPR. Over two years, we will focus on governance, automation, and regulatory alignment through four targeted AI projects.

## Projects Included

### 1. AI Model Risk & Compliance Monitoring *(6-9 months)*
Develop an AI-powered system to assess AI models for regulatory compliance, ensuring adherence to UNIQA’s internal policies and the AI Act.

### 2. Automated Claims Processing *(12-18 months)*
Deploy an AI/ML system to streamline claims assessment, reducing manual workload while maintaining fairness, transparency, and bias mitigation.

### 3. AI Ethics & Bias Auditing Framework *(9-12 months)*
Implement an AI-driven framework to detect and mitigate biases in underwriting and claims decisions, reinforcing ethical AI practices.

### 4. Regulatory Guidance Chatbot *(6-9 months)*
Introduce an AI chatbot to assist employees in understanding and applying UNIQA’s AI governance policies, enhancing compliance awareness.

## Project Timeline & Integration
Each project follows a structured timeline within the two-year portfolio:

- **AI Model Risk & Compliance Monitoring:** Establishes a compliance foundation before broader AI adoption.
- **Automated Claims Processing:** A longer-term initiative requiring phased deployment and regulatory validation.
- **AI Ethics & Bias Auditing Framework:** Launches after compliance monitoring to strengthen fairness in AI models.
- **Regulatory Guidance Chatbot:** Supports compliance initiatives while educating employees.

This phased approach ensures compliance and risk management precede automation, with governance frameworks reinforcing ethical AI use.

## Context & Background

These projects were developed as part of my **AI Strategy and Governance Certificate** from the **University of Pennsylvania (via Coursera)**. They demonstrate practical skills in designing AI strategies, governance frameworks, and regulatory compliance aligned with industry best practices.

## Goal & Impact
Balancing automation with governance, these initiatives will ensure UNIQA achieves sustainable innovation and regulatory compliance, establishing a robust AI strategy aligned with ethical best practices.
