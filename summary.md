# Executive Summary: UNIQA AI Portfolio

This AI portfolio outlines a strategic two-year roadmap for UNIQA to lead in responsible, AI-powered insurance innovation. It includes four key projects designed to balance automation with governance:

1. **AI Model Risk & Compliance Monitoring**  
   Builds a regulatory foundation for all AI models by ensuring alignment with UNIQA’s internal policies, GDPR, and the AI Act.

2. **Automated Claims Processing**  
   Streamlines claims operations using AI/ML while maintaining fairness, transparency, and auditability.

3. **AI Ethics & Bias Auditing Framework**  
   Implements mechanisms to detect and mitigate biases in underwriting and claims, reinforcing ethical AI usage.

4. **Regulatory Guidance Chatbot**  
   Supports employees by providing accessible guidance on internal AI policies and compliance requirements.

Each project follows a structured timeline, placing governance and compliance ahead of large-scale automation. The portfolio reflects UNIQA’s commitment to ethical innovation, transparency, and customer trust — setting a strong example in the evolving landscape of AI governance and insurance.
